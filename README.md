This project aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized system for tracking the authenticity of electronic components, such as phone batteries, cameras, screens, and more. Currently, many companies rely on centralized systems to monitor products throughout the supply chain. However, these systems are prone to manipulation, leading to the circulation of counterfeit products in both legitimate and black markets.  By integrating blockchain, we propose a transparent, tamper-proof solution that enables stakeholders to easily verify the authenticity of products at each stage of the supply chain, from manufacturing to second-hand resale. Each product will be encoded and assigned a unique digital identity on the blockchain, allowing continuous tracking through the entire lifecycleâ€”manufacturing, logistics, retail, and even second-hand usage.  This system will not only safeguard against the sale of counterfeit products but also ensure that consumers have access to verifiable product histories, including repair and ownership records.  Additionally, the project includes a marketplace feature, allowing users to securely resell old mobile phones, laptops, and other electronics. Buyers can verify the authenticity and condition of these devices through their blockchain records, providing a trusted platform for second-hand transactions.
